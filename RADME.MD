<H>Welcome to my github<\>

Many of my projects are private as they are either not ready to be oppened or are old code that is not representative of my current abilities
Most of my projects are work in progress, I usually start them in the interest of picking up new skill, for instance, my work in progress project ProxMine was started to learn about OpenAL and networking withy Sockets in Java.

By no means is this a complete repository of all my projects as many would not represent my current capabilities. 
Since much of my previous code has been first steps the programs were not ment to be public, i am just now starting to release my code to the public. 
You can check back to see my further development
