### Welcome to UntimelyRock's GitHub

The vast majority of my projects are not currently represented here.
The ones that are currently available are work in progress.

Every one of my projects represents a new skill that I desire to learn. Whether it's using OpenAL and Socket Netorwing in Java (Prox Mine),
or creating GUIs and 3D editors (PackIDE/PackEdior). 

The majority of my projects are not public as I feel they either don't represent my current ability, 
or were created as practice or private tools and are thus unsuitable for a public repository.

Be assured I will continue working on projects in my spare time between classes and my other hobbies, please check back for my continued development. 
If you wish, please provide any pointers (pun intended) or advice on my projects, please do. However, I'm not currently accepting pull requests on any unless stated otherwise.
